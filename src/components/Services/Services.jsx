        I have been a freelance developer for nearly two years, during which 
        time I have had the opportunity <br /> to work with agencies, consult for 
         startups, and collaborate with other talented individuals on web projects <br />
          for both business and consumer use. My primary area of expertise is front-end development, <br /> including HTML, CSS, JS, React JS, and Material UI. I am   
          skilled in creating  responsive <br /> websites that are fast, user-friendly, and 
           built using best practices.<br /> In addition, I have experience with   popular open-source CMS platforms <br /> such as WordPress, Webflow, and Wix. For more 
            information, <br />  please visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/front-end-react-dev/" target="_blank" className="lnkdn">LinkedIn</a> profile or contact me directly.
